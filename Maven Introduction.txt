Maven
======
Maven is powerful build tool for java projects
you can actually build projects using java or other languages using Maven
Maven is developed in java
Maven is build by apache organization

What is build tool?
================
when we develop an applicaton there will be many activities

Generating Source Code
Generating Documentation from the source code
Compiling the Source Code
Packing the compiled code into JAR or WAR files
Installing/deploying the packaged code on a server or somewhere else in client place
etc.,

The advantage of using build tool is automating the process of building an application that minimize human errors.
Application can be built faster than a manually performing all steps.

Maven can be used for building around 3000+ archetypes(templates).

we can use any of these templates for building different kind of projects

Example
=======
org.apache.maven.quickstart => for developing an simple java project
org.apache.maven.webapp => for developing web based applications 
etc., 

java.util
java.lang
java.io
java.sql etc.,


What is XML?
===========
Extended Markup Language like HTML it also contains tags
using xml we can create our own tags
for every opening tag there will be closing tag
Tags in XML are case sensitive

Example
=======
  <Swapna>
         <city>Bangalore</city>
         <country>India</country>
  </Swapna>

Pom.xml file is brain of the maven project where we can define dependencies and manipulate them according to the requirement

Maven downloads dependencies from three types of repositories

Central Repository => Internet => https://mvnrepository.com/

Remote Repository(Company Server) => Remote Server => configuration of this server will be done by maven admin or
				you will get list of instructions from client

local Repository => local machine under C:\Users\<laptop name>\.m2
